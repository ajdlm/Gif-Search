# Sci-Fi Movie Gifs: The Search Engine

A page that uses the Giphy API to find and display gifs related to different science fiction movies.

## How to Use

* When the page loads, 20 different buttons will be displayed, each with the name of a different science fiction movie.

* Whenever the user clicks on one of these buttons, the page will use the name of the chosen film to query the Giphy API for 10 gifs.

* These gifs will then be displayed on the page.

* Each time that the user clicks on one of the buttons, whichever gifs were displayed previously will disappear before being replaced by the new ones.

* The user can also add additional buttons to the list by entering the text of the button they want into the input field next to ADD A FILM and either pressing enter or clicking on the SUBMIT button.

* Any buttons that the user adds in this way can be clicked on to the same effect as the buttons displayed when the page initially loads.

* While the page is designed to display gifs related to science fiction movies, the user may create buttons with whatever text he or she wishes and then use these to search for gifs.

* That said, a button will only be created if the input field contains at least one character that isn't a space.
